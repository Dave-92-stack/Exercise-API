## Application Concept


This application is intended to function like a fitness tracker. It is designed
to let users catalogue their weekly routines, compare the results with prior logs,
and track overall fitness.

--------

## Background

For my capstone project I wanted to build an application that I would actually use, return to consistently, and be able to think up regular innovations. To me, that meant I needed to view myself as a consumer and build something I wanted to use. So, I started by examining what activities I did regularly; first daily, then weekly, and monthly. Eventually I settled on building my own fitness app as there was a wealth of similar apps I could use for reference and I could cater it to my own routine.

## Planning

Once I had an idea of what I wanted to make, I then reviewed the requirements for the project. Initially I considered building the application with Python instead of JavaScript however, I didn’t want to bite off more than I could chew. Looking back, I’ve struggled with meeting minimal requirements by the due date. So, I decided to stick with the language I had greater experience with. From there the planning process was fairly straight forward; I composed several wireframes based on common habits for fitness apps, drew out the relationship between a user and their workouts in an entity-relationship-diagram, and must have read the prescribed project outline over a dozen times.

## Process

My process for the capstone project saw me finally heed the one concern I kept repeating to myself all course long. Start early and invest a lot of hours. For the first two days, I started working by 8am and stopped working at 6pm. This breakneck pace allowed me to; research other workout apps, compose my prework, and begin coding far earlier than previous projects. By Thursday night the functionality of my API was finished and I’d started working on my Client. Friday I started working on my Client and invested a large portion of my weekend as well. When Monday rolled around I was in a position where only a few debugging questions were needed to meet all functionality requirements of my app.

## Problem Solving

The biggest tool I used for problem solving during this project was using the issue queue. While I did post more of my own problems than in previous projects, I also read through previous posts that were already closed. I found that most of my fellow programmers had already asked similar issues to what I was having and this allowed me to piece together my own patches.
